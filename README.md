# Domenator
Dome generator for POV, STL, OBJ

	
Hi

Here is Domenator, a 3D Shape generator using OpenGL.

There are many parameters in this utility, but they are very simple to use (any way you see immediately the effect for most of them), and there is a 
"Panic Button".

To try it you just have to choose a Base and a Slope, nothing else is mandatory.

When you press the "INC" button, it generates an INC file that you can use in your POV Scene. You can choose STL or OBJ instead of INC
